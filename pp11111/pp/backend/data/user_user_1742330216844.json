    "Page 1:\n\nOnce upon a gloomy day, in a small town nestled between lofty mountains lived a brave adventurer, Sami. He was a man of around 30 years of age, with light brown skin and sleek black hair. He wore a wristwatch which held time from all corners of the world, and a necklace gifted by his grandmother that was said to bring good luck.\n\nSami had a zest for life and loved unraveling mysteries. On this particular day, he decided to embark on an adventure into the legendary Dark Forest, a mysterious patch of trees that bordered his town. No one dared to step in there due to the strange tales that surrounded it. However, the enigma of the forest enticed Sami, filling him with a desire to explore its depths.\n\nPage 2:\n\nAs Sami entered the forest, the light around him dimmed; the rustle of the leaves and the song of distant",
    "birds echoed around him ominously. He felt an air of mystique and enthrallment. Suddenly, he found himself face-to-face with a strange and mesmerizing creature.\n\nThe creature had twinkling, wise eyes, and it spoke, its voice echoing around the silent forest. \"Mortal,\" it said. \"You have entered the forbidden land. If you wish to go further, you must solve my riddles three.\"\n\nSami, who loved a good challenge, nodded his head in agreement. The creature started with the first riddle: 'What has keys but can't open locks?' After a moment, Sami's face lit with realization. \"A piano!\" he exclaimed, and the creature confirmed this was correct.\n\nPage 3:\n\nThe creature then asked the second riddle, 'I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?' After some thought, Sami answered, \"An echo.\" \n\nDelighted, the creature presented the final and toughest riddle, \"What",
    "begins and has no end? What is the ending of all that begins?\"  Sami scratched his chin, deep in thought. Suddenly, a smile spread across his face. \"Time,\" he said confidently.\n\nThe creature, now cheerful, clapped its hands. Suddenly, a hidden door in a large tree trunk opened, revealing a bright, enchanting path leading to an unknown place. Extremely excited, Sami strided in, leaving the Dark Forest behind.\n\nHis encounter with the creature, the riddles, and the adventure he took on his birthday gave him a story to narrate to his kid brother Ahmad, who was turning fourteen, curious, and full of life, just like Sami at his age.\n\nAnd so, dear Ahmad, on your 14th birthday, here's a tale of courage, wit, and mystery, reminding you that life is an adventure, full of surprises and riddles to solve. Remember: the Dark Forests we fear often hold the most fascinating surprises!"
