    "Page 1:\nOnce upon a time, there lived a little green turtle named Leo. He wore a small, bright red backpack which made his green skin pop even more. His little red backpack was ready, and so was his heart. Walking slowly, Leo moved through the big, colourful gates of the school. He looked around with wide sparkling eyes, completely amazed by the sight of the playground. He saw round, bendy slides, giant swings, and big drawing boards which the kids used for painting. He met his teacher, Mrs. Leo discovered that learning could be fun. In the lunchtime, Leo sat with his new friends on the bright blue table. Leo found the first day of school fun and exciting filled with new friends and learning. He had painted a picture, learned a new song, and made a best friend. Now, every day, Leo packs his red backpack, ready to explore more. Now, Leo loves going to school and enjoys every bit of it. Exploring a world of learning and creating wonderful memories each day."
