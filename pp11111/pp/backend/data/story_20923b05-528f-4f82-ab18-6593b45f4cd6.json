That's tall like our school,\" he thought. The fish seemed to say, \"Good luck, Leo! Page 4: A butterfly landed on Leo's backpack. Page 5: At the school gate, Leo looked at the big building. Page 6: In his classroom, Leo saw colorful seats. He chose one right at the front. They shared funny stories and laughed while munching. Page 8: By the end of the day, Leo couldn't wait to come back. Page 9: Tired but happy, Leo went home. He thought, \"I love school! He saw himself learning, playing, and making more friends each day."
