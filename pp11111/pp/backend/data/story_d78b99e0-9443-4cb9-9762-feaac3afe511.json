    "Page 1:\nPage 1: Leo the turtle woke up early. His heart fluttered with excitement as he put on a red backpack. The bus stop was at the end of the blue pond. Page 3: The school bus was huge! Leo climbed aboard, his red backpack contrasting against his green skin. Page 4: Inside, the bus was a rainbow of colors, filled with many different creatures. Leo found a seat next to an orange hare who had big friendly eyes. The rabbitâ€™s name was Rocky. This made Leo feel much less anxious. It was a large brick building, surrounded by a beautiful green field. His first day at school was about to begin. He scanned the room, taking in the colorful posters and the smell of new books. Page 8: As the day went on, Leo learned new things and made even more friends. He felt happy and safe. Surprisingly, even lettuce tasted better at school. Page 10: At the end of the day, Leo climbed onto the bus, smiling. As he reached home, he realized something."
