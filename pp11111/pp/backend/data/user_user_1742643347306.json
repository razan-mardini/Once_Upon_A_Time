    "Dedication: To my little sister, Lily, who always dreams big. Happy 7th Birthday! ---\n\nPage 1:\n\nOnce upon a time in a small haven surrounded by enchanted woods, lived a brave, imaginative and fun-loving boy named Alex. A charming boy of six, Alex often explored the forest with his bright fair skin, twinkling eyes, messy blonde hair, a warm green scarf around his neck and a wooden toy sword by his side. Page 2:\n\nThis particular day, Alex ventured deeper into the forest than he usually did.",
    "As sunbeams pierced the shelter of the canopy, turning the twinkling leaves to a golden flare, his eyes landed on an enormous, wondrous tree he never saw before. Against its other wooden brothers, this one stood different. Its leaves were as vibrant as a rainbow and around it danced vague sparkles. Page 3:\n\nBeing an adventure-loving lad, a rush of excitement overcame Alex. He dashed to the tree.",
    "Just as he neared it, an ambrosial voice echoed, “Hello Alex, I am the Magic Tree. ” His eyes widened in amazement, and a nervous, yet, anticipative smile formed on his face. The tree, as if reading his thoughts, spoke again, \"I am here to grant you a wish, choose wisely. \"\n\nPage 4:\n\nA twinkle sparked in Alex's eyes. He thought of so many things he wanted: an everlasting supply of candies, the grandest castle, perhaps a mighty dragon!",
    "However, he then remembered his friends back home, his family, and his sister Lily, with whom he loved to share his adventures and treasures. Page 5:\n\nPondering for a moment, Alex looked at the magical tree and uttered his wish confidently, \"I want a bag that gives an endless supply of candies. Not just for me, but enough to share with everyone back home! \" The tree swayed gently as enchanting sparkles twirled around it. Within seconds, a golden bag appeared at the foot of the tree.",
    "Page 6:\n\nFilled with excitement, Alex peeked into the bag and to his joy, he saw it brimming with all sorts of colorful candies. He beamed with happiness. Not only would he enjoy these candies, but he could also share them with his family and all his friends! Page 7:\n\n\"Thank you, Magic Tree! \" exclaimed Alex, his heart fluttering with excitement.",
    "He was thrilled about the thought of sharing his magical candies. He ran back to his village, clutching the golden bag tight. The tree waved him off, closing its tree-eyes, waiting for the next wanderer to discover it. Page 8:\n\nSoon, the news of Alex's magical candy bag spread across the village. Happiness filled the air as everyone laughed, ate candy, and danced.",
    "Alex shared his candies generously, his face glowing with satisfaction as he learnt an important lesson that the joy of sharing was indeed magical. Page 9:\n\nThat night as Alex recounted his adventure to Lily, he watched her eyes widen with awe. He handed her the first candy from his magical bag and as she beamed in gratitude, he felt another wish come true - to see his little sister happy. The magic was not just in the tree or the candies, but it was in the act of sharing and spreading love. THE END\n\n--- \n\nThis story is for you, dear Lily.",
    "Just like Alex, may you always have the courage to seek magic and the wisdom to share what you find. Happy Birthday, my brave adventurer and generous sharer, Lily! Enjoy the magic of being seven!"
